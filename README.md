-   A game similar to snake for 1 - 4 players
-   Click on a button with coloured dots to play, click on as many dots for how many players you want
-   Click on instructions to learn how to play
-   Click on Credits to see who did what work
-   Once the game starts try to kill your opponents by having them run into your trail
-   Last one standin wins
-   In single player mode, try to get the best time
-   Have fun :)
